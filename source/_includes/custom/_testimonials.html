    The guys at Bear Metal have been instrumental to Wildfire’s rise to success. Without exception we could trust them to do what’s best for the company’s bottom line with limited managerial oversight.

    Hiring a development and operations team, especially one that’s distributed and overseas, is always unnerving. I have heard far more horror stories than I have successes when it comes to working with overseas contract developers. But in our case we hit the jackpot by finding these guys when we founded Wildfire. While they weren’t technically cofounders, there was never any question that they cared for Wildfire like it was their own child.

    The Bear Metal team was 100% reliable, very talented and a true pleasure to work with. I wholeheartedly recommend them.
