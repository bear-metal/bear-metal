    <h3>Data Collection</h3>

    <p>
      Be it from IoT devices, server processes, user surveys, or sensors in the
      middle of the sea, we have experience in getting the data out of the
      woodworks.

    <h3>Data Transfer</h3>

    <p>
      Getting your data from the source to your system fast, efficiently, and
      securely is of utmost importance. Often the data travels through the usual
      means such as HTTP(S), but sometimes that's not quite enough. That's when
      we step in.

    <h3>Data Processing/Storage</h3>

    <p>
      We have operated system ranging from physical servers in our own rack to
      hosted virtual servers to cloud services like AWS to serverless
      applications. Sometimes a single node is enough, sometimes you need
      thousands. We've seen both, and everything in between.

    <h3>Data Insight</h3>

    <p>
      Data alone is just noise. What matters is how you turn it into insight and
      business value. We have long experience in fetching the important bits out
      of massive amounts of data, through dashboards, visualizations, and AI.
