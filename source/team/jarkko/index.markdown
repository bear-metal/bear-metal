# Jarkko Laine

Jarkko is the resident armchair psychologist and jack of all trades at Bear Metal, his duties ranging from user interface design to backend development to business development and marketing.

Jarkko is a diehard endurance sports enthusiast and a national level orienteer. His other disciplines include running both on and off-road, cross-country skiing, cycling and multisports from triathlon to multi-day adventure races.

Jarkko was one of the earliest Ruby on Rails enthusiast by semi-accidentally ending up body doubling DHH in the Rails workshop in EuroOSCON 2005.
