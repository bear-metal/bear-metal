# Lourens Naudé

Lourens specializes in backend / platform / domain solutions and is well versed full stack, from VM to high level protocols. He is known for his offbeat Ruby patches and extensions.

Current interests include disruptive communications technology like [ZeroMQ](http://www.zeromq.org), operations tools as well as biofeedback and anything where business, technology and the health sector meet. I also like automation and small tools that can [learn from and optimize infrastructure](https://www.tunemygc.com). He travels frequently, but constantly thinks of better ways and processes to move people and their belongings around.

He frequently runs Ultra Trails, developed a muesli addiction and blogs about his adventures at [Island Ultra](http://www.islandultra.com). Lourens, along with the rest of Bear Metal, believes in a healthy work-life balance and as such spends free time either up in the mountains or at sea in sunny [Madeira Island](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeira).
