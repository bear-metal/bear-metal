## Octopress Contributing Guidelines

We love to see people contributing to Octopress, whether it's a bug report,
feature suggestion or a pull request. At the moment, we try to keep the core
slick and lean, focusing on basic blogging needs, so some of your suggestions
might not find their way into Octopress. For those ideas, we started a
[list of 3rd party plug-ins](https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-party-plugins),
where you can link your own Octopress plug-in repositories.

For the future, we're thinking about ways to more easily add them them into
our main releases.

**All development work is currently happening on the `2.1` branch and all PRs should be
submitted against that branch for the time being.** We will, however, still accept
critical patches against master where needed.

Happy Blogging!
